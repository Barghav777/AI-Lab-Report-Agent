It is a highly productive and effective method for creating complex profiles that are difficult to achieve with conventional turning. For gear cutting, a dividing head is used to index the job, rotating it by a precise amount after each tooth is cut to ensure uniform spacing.\n\nProcedure: A gear blank was turned to the required diameter of 75 mm. A Number 4, module 3 gear cutter was selected and fixed on the milling machine arbor. The gear blank was mounted on a mandrel between the dividing head and the tail stock. The machine table was centered accurately relative to the cutter. A proper depth of cut was set, and the gear cutting operation was started. After each tooth was cut, the dividing head was used to index the blank for the next tooth, and the process was repeated until all 23 teeth were cut.\n\nObservations:\n- Module (m): 3\n- Number of Teeth (Z): 23\n- Actual Measured Tooth Depth: 6.70 mm\n- Actual Measured Tooth Thickness: 4.65 mm\n\nCalculations / Results:\n- Theoretical Gear Blank Diameter = m * (Z + 2) = 3 * (23 + 2) = 75 mm.\n- Theoretical Tooth Depth = 2.25 * m = 2.25 * 3 = 6.75 mm.\n- Theoretical Tooth Thickness (Circular Pitch / 2) = (3.14 * m) / 2 = (3.14 * 3) / 2 = 4.71 mm.\n- Index Crank Movement = 40 / Z = 40 / 23 = 1 and 17/23, meaning one full rotation and 17 holes in a 23-hole circle.\n- Percentage Variation in Tooth Depth = ((6.75 - 6.70) / 6.75) * 100 = 0.74%.\n\nConclusion: A spur gear with 23 teeth and module 3 was successfully machined.

In orthogonal cutting, this force is resolved into two measurable components: the main cutting force (Fc) in the direction of motion, and the thrust or feed force (FD/Ft) in the direction of feed. These forces are measured using a dynamometer and are critical for calculating machine power requirements and analyzing machining stability.\n\nProcedure: A mild steel rod was mounted in a lathe's three-jaw chuck. A single-point cutting tool was mounted on a Kistler dynamometer, which was fitted to the lathe. Turning operations were performed by varying the feed rate and spindle speed according to the observation table, and the resulting forces (Fx, Fy, Fz) were recorded.\n\nObservations:\n- Work Material: Mild Steel (Diameter = 20 mm)\n- Depth of Cut: 1.0 mm\n- Rake Angle: +3.5°\n| Trial | Spindle Speed (RPM) | Feed Rate (mm/rev) | Measured Fc (N) | Measured Ft (N) |\n|-------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| 1     | 500                 | 0.1                | 350             | 150             |\n| 2     | 500                 | 0.2                | 550             | 250             |\n| 3     | 800                 | 0.1                | 330             | 140             |\n\nCalculations / Results:\nThe cutting speed (V) is calculated using the formula V = (π * D * S) / 1000.\n- For Trials 1 & 2 (500 RPM): V = (3.14 * 20 * 500) / 1000 = 31.4 m/min.\n- For Trial 3 (800 RPM): V = (3.14 * 20 * 800) / 1000 = 50.24 m/min.\n\nConclusion: The cutting forces were measured successfully. The results show that doubling the feed rate from 0.1 to 0.2 mm/rev at a constant speed (Trial 1 vs. 2) significantly increased both the cutting force Fc and thrust force Ft. Increasing the cutting speed (Trial 1 vs. 3) at a constant feed rate resulted in a slight decrease in cutting forces."}

The wire never physically touches the workpiece; a spark gap is maintained. This causes the final cut slot (kerf) to be wider than the wire diameter. The overcut is the extra width on one side of the wire, calculated as (Total Spark Gap) / 2, where the Total Spark Gap is the Measured Slot Width minus the Wire Diameter.\n\nProcedure: A 10mm cut was performed on a mild steel block using a wire EDM machine. Two samples were created by varying a key machining parameter, the peak current (IP), from 40 A to 80 A. After machining, the final dimensions of the cut slot were measured to determine the overcut.\n\nObservations:\n- Programmed Length: 10.0 mm\n- Wire Diameter: 0.25 mm\n- Peak Current (IP), Sample 1: 40 A\n- Final Cut Length, Sample 1: 10.35 mm\n- Peak Current (IP), Sample 2: 80 A\n- Final Cut Length, Sample 2: 10.48 mm\n\nCalculations / Results:\n1. Overcut for Sample 1 (IP = 40 A):\n   - Measured Slot Width (Kerf) = 10.35 mm.\n   - Total Spark Gap = 0.35 mm - 0.25 mm = 0.10 mm.\n   - Overcut (one side) = 0.10 mm / 2 = 0.05 mm.\n2. Overcut for Sample 2 (IP = 80 A):\n   - Measured Slot Width (Kerf) = 10.48 mm.\n   - Total Spark Gap = 0.48 mm - 0.25 mm = 0.23 mm.\n   - Overcut (one side) = 0.23 mm / 2 = 0.115 mm.\n\nConclusion: The experiment demonstrates that increasing the peak current (IP) in Wire EDM directly increases the overcut. An increase from 40 A to 80 A more than doubled the overcut from 0.05 mm to 0.115 mm. This is because a higher peak current creates a more powerful spark, removing more material and resulting in a wider cutting gap."}

Surface grinding is a finishing process that uses a rotating abrasive wheel to produce a very flat and smooth surface. Grinding is generally capable of achieving a much lower surface roughness (a better finish) than milling because it removes material in much smaller chips.\n\nProcedure: A mild steel flat of size 60x60x15 mm was machined using a vertical milling machine at two different spindle speeds (350 RPM and 540 RPM). A second identical mild steel flat was machined using a surface grinder. The surface roughness (Ra) of all three machined surfaces was measured using a surface roughness tester.\n\nObservations:\n- Material: Mild Steel\n| Machining Process  | Spindle Speed | Measured Ra (μm) |\n|--------------------|---------------|------------------|\n| Face Milling       | 350 RPM       | 3.2              |\n| Face Milling       | 540 RPM       | 2.1              |\n| Surface Grinding   | N/A           | 0.8              |\n\nCalculations / Results:\nNo calculations are required for this experiment. The results are based on the direct measurement of surface roughness values.\n\nConclusion: The experimental results clearly demonstrate that surface grinding produces a superior surface finish compared to face milling on mild steel. The surface grinder achieved an Ra value of 0.8 μm, which is significantly smoother than the best finish from the milling machine (2.1 μm). The experiment also showed that for milling, increasing the cutter speed from 350 RPM to 540 RPM improved the surface finish, reducing the Ra value from 3.2 to 2.1 μm."}
